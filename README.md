### Option 1: Virtual Machine (only for emulators)

#### Prerequisites

* Either [VMware Player](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html) (free), [VMware Workstation Pro](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-pro.html) (paid) or [Oracle VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) (free)
* [Debian 11.1 ISO](https://cdimage.debian.org/mirror/cdimage/archive/11.1.0/amd64/iso-cd/debian-11.1.0-amd64-netinst.iso) (newer versions not tested)
* [VirtualHere USB Client](https://www.virtualhere.com/usb_client_software) for Windows, Linux or MacOS

#### Guide

1. Make a new virtual machine with Debian in your software of choice. Select your ISO file and choose the appropriate operating system (Linux -> Debian 11.x 64-bit) if you're asked. **To make sure your VM is accessible on the network, please follow the instructions in the troubleshooting section on this page (either for [VirtualBox](#webpage-not-reachable-oracle-virtualbox) or [VMware](#webpage-not-reachable-vmware)).**

2. When first booting the Debian VM, select `Graphical install`. In the configuration, leave everything on default. Only change your language, set `debian` as hostname, don't set a root password, choose an account name and password, set partition to "yes" and `/dev/sda` for the GRUB bootloader.

3. After rebooting, log in with your password. Then click the menu on the upper left corner, search for "Terminal" and open it.

4. Run the following commands (you can copy and paste with right click):
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y git usbip hwdata curl python build-essential libusb-1.0-0-dev libudev-dev
   echo "usbip-core" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
   echo "usbip-vudc" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
   echo "vhci-hcd" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
   
   echo "dtoverlay=dwc2" | sudo tee -a /boot/config.txt
   echo "dwc2" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
   echo "libcomposite" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
   echo "usb_f_rndis" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
   
   git config pull.rebase false
   git clone https://github.com/Berny23/LD-ToyPad-Emulator.git
   cd LD-ToyPad-Emulator
   
   printf '\necho "usbip-vudc.0" > UDC\nusbipd -D --device\nsleep 2;\nusbip attach -r debian -b usbip-vudc.0\nchmod a+rw /dev/hidg0' >> usb_setup_script.sh
   sudo curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/virtualhere/script/main/install_server | sudo sh
   
   sudo cp usb_setup_script.sh /usr/local/bin/toypad_usb_setup.sh
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/toypad_usb_setup.sh
   (sudo crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "@reboot sudo /usr/local/bin/toypad_usb_setup.sh") | sudo crontab -
   ```

5. Reboot you device with this command:
   ```bash
   sudo shutdown -r now
   ```

6. Log in again and run the following commands in the terminal:
   ```bash
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
   export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
   [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
   [ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"
   
   nvm install 11
   sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep `readlink -f \`which node\``
   npm install --global node-gyp@8.4.1
   npm config set node_gyp $(npm prefix -g)/lib/node_modules/node-gyp/bin/node-gyp.js
   
   cd LD-ToyPad-Emulator
   npm install
   ```

#### Usage

1. Start the virtual machine if it's not already running. Then start the **VirtualHere USB Client** and double click on `LEGO READER V2.10`.

2. Run the emulator server with this command if you are in the correct folder (otherwise run `cd    LD-ToyPad-Emulator` first):
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

3. Type `http://debian` in a browser to use the emulator.

   If you want to turn it off, just press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal, then use the command `sudo shutdown now` to power off the virtual machine or just pause it from the host.
   
4. Finally, start your console emulator and the game itself (e.g. Cemu).

### Option 2: Single Board Computer

#### Prerequisites
* **Raspberry Pi Zero W** ($10) or similar single board computer with Network support
  * **NOTE**: Will NOT work with Rapsberry Pi: 2, 3, 3A, 3A+, 3B, 3B+. These models lack the ability to become a usb gadget.
* **USB Type-A to micro-USB 2.0 Type-B cable** that supports data transmission (e. g. your phone's charging cable)
* 2 GB+ Micro SD card
* Internet connection on your PC and single board computer

#### Guide

1. If you're using a Raspberry Pi Zero W, flash Raspberry Pi OS Lite to your SD card using [the Raspberry Pi Imager tool](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) and follow [this](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/headless.md) as well as [this](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/remote-access/ssh/README.md) instruction for headless installation.

2. Connect your device to your PC via USB cable (don't use the port on the edge of the Pi Zero!).

4. Use SSH to run the following commands (Don't know the IP address? Try [this IP scanner](https://www.advanced-ip-scanner.com/).):
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y git libusb-1.0-0-dev libudev-dev
   echo "dtoverlay=dwc2" | sudo tee -a /boot/config.txt
   echo "dwc2" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
   echo "libcomposite" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
   echo "usb_f_rndis" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules
   
   git config pull.rebase false
   git clone https://github.com/Berny23/LD-ToyPad-Emulator.git
   cd LD-ToyPad-Emulator
   
   printf '\necho "$UDC" > UDC\nsleep 2;\nchmod a+rw /dev/hidg0' >> usb_setup_script.sh
   
   sudo cp usb_setup_script.sh /usr/local/bin/toypad_usb_setup.sh
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/toypad_usb_setup.sh
   (sudo crontab -l 2>/dev/null; echo "@reboot sudo /usr/local/bin/toypad_usb_setup.sh") | sudo crontab -
   ```
   
5. Reboot you device with this command:
   ```bash
   sudo shutdown -r now
   ```
   
6. Connect via SSH again and run the following commands:
   ```bash
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash
   export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
   [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
   [ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"
   
   nvm install 11
   sudo setcap cap_net_bind_service=+ep `readlink -f \`which node\``
   npm install --global node-gyp@8.4.1
   npm config set node_gyp $(npm prefix -g)/lib/node_modules/node-gyp/bin/node-gyp.js
   
   cd LD-ToyPad-Emulator
   npm install
   ```

#### Usage
1. Run the emulator server with this command if you are in the correct folder (otherwise run `cd    LD-ToyPad-Emulator` first):
   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

2. Type **your single board computer's IP address** in a browser to use the emulator.

   If you want to turn it off, just press `Ctrl + C` in the cmd window, then use the command `sudo shutdown now` to safely power off the device.

## Update
To update this software, just get the latest changes by running the following commands while inside the `LD-ToyPad-Emulator` folder:
````bash
git fetch
git checkout origin/HEAD && git checkout origin/HEAD package-lock.json
npm install
````

## Troubleshooting

### RPCS3 cannot detect the Toy Pad
**This solution works only for RPCS3 and will break the Toy Pad detection with every other emulator!**

Download and run [Zadig](https://zadig.akeo.ie).

Click on `Options` and tick `List All Devices`. Select `LEGO READER V2.10` in the dropdown menu, then select `WinUSB` if it's not already selected, click on the `Replace Driver` button and on `Yes` in the dialog.

After the installation has finished, exit Zadig and restart RPCS3. If you get stuck on the main menu, just close the game, right-click on it in the RPCS3 games list, select `Change Custom Configuration`, switch to the `Network` tab and choose `Disconnected` in both drop-down menus. The game will now correctly detect the Toy Pad.

To undo the changes from Zadig, you have to rollback the driver:
1. Open `Device Manager`, scroll down to `USB devices` and expand the section.
2. Double-click `LEGO READER V2.10`.
3. Switch to the `Driver` tab, click `Previous Driver`, select the first option and click yes.

### Webpage not reachable (Oracle VirtualBox)
Shutdown your virtual machine (icon in the upper right corner). In VirtualBox's manager, click your image and open `Settings`. Under `Network` change `Attached to:` to `Bridged Adapter` and click `ok`. Start your virtual machine.

### Webpage not reachable (VMware)
Shutdown your virtual machine (icon in the upper right corner). Right-click on your virtual machine's name in VMware Workstation or VMware Player and click `Settings...`. Click on `Network Adapter` and select `Bridged`. Click `OK` and start your virtual machine.

### Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::80
Either close any other software that is using the port 80 or manually edit the last line of index.js (with `nano index.js`, edit the line, then press `Ctrl + O`, `Enter` and `Ctrl + X`).

If you did this, you may need to append your selected port to the address in the browser (like `http://debian:500` or `http://192.168.0.165:500` if your port is 500).

### VirtualHere USB Client doesn't show LEGO READER V2.10
When installing the virtual machine, you have to set the hostname to `debian`.

Alternatively, copy the following command and replace `YOUR_IP_ADDRESS` with your virtual machine's IP address (it looks like `192.168.X.X`, run `hostname -I` to show it). After you've done this, run the modified command while you're inside the `LD-ToyPad-Emulator` folder.
````bash
git reset --hard ; printf '\necho "usbip-vudc.0" > UDC\nusbipd -D --device\nsleep 2;\nusbip attach -r YOUR_IP_ADDRESS -b usbip-vudc.0\nchmod a+rw /dev/hidg0' >> usb_setup_script.sh ; sudo cp usb_setup_script.sh /usr/local/bin/toypad_usb_setup.sh
````

### VirtualHere shows LEGO READER V2.10, but fails with "Operation not permitted"
When double clicking on "LEGO READER V2.10", if it returns `Error "Operation not permitted" (-1) trying to use this device.`. Try these steps:

1. Right click the device in the VirtualHere Client and select "Custom Event Handler..."
2. Add `onReset.$VENDOR_ID$.$PRODUCT_ID$=` 

Then try using the device again. 

### Webpage not reachable under http://debian/
If you're using a virtual machine, make sure you've applied the solution specific to your software first ([VirtualBox](#webpage-not-reachable-oracle-virtualbox) or [VMware](#webpage-not-reachable-vmware))!

After that, run the command `hostname -I` in your virtual machine (or on your single board computer) and type the IP address that looks like `192.168.X.X` in your webbrowser.
